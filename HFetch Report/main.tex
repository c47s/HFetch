\title{HFetch: A User-Friendly API Client for the Schoology LMS}
\author{Nathaniel Waterman}
\date{March 3, 2018}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Schoology is popular and powerful, but it takes time to check for homework posted there.
This was the reason for designing HFetch,
	which uses a RESTful API to fetch, display, and provide details about
	assignments from Schoology in 2 clicks, or 1 if it is launched automatically.

The introduction to Schoology's API documentation mentions that there were no Schoology API clients at the time it was written, but an implementation in Java was found on GitHub (rvanasa/schoology-api).
This paper intends to inform the reader about HFetch, seemingly the second such API client.
