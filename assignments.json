      "title": "RoboScratch",
      "description": "RoboScratch\nLesson Plan for Grade 8, Programming Design\nPrepared by Mrs. Michaud\nOVERVIEW & PURPOSE:\nRoboScratch teaches linear programming without the complexities of loops and conditions.  With RoboScratch, function blocks are added to the workspace to create a sketch. Specific parameters of each block, such as wait for the camera to see an object, wait for speech, or execute a movement action. Link blocks and instruct your robot to perform behaviors and complete tasks. \nOBJECTIVES:  Each student will...\n\nBrainstorm and design a Roboscratch Program using Actions, Camera Take Picture, Move, Play Sound, Say, Forward, Backward, and Sleep. \nLoad Program, Connect the JD, Calibrate, Design programs, and Play in RoboScratch.\n\nMATERIALS NEEDED\n\nEZ JD Humanoid Robot\nWindows OS with EZ Builder Software\n\nRobotScratch Programming ACTIVITY: Click the image below to access link,\n\n What Is RoboScratch?\nRoboScratch teaches linear programming without the complexities of loops and conditions. Even though EZ-Builder includes Blockly, we recommend RoboScratch for beginners to teach logical execution of commands. Programming is a similar to a food recipe, in that instructions are to be completed in order. RoboScratch provides a fun and engaging way of identifying how to organize instructions to complete tasks. Similar to Blockly, RoboScratch generates real usable code with friendly comments. The initiative of scratch-like development environments is meant to teach programming and order of instructions. The RoboScratch approach provides the ability to learn how to program quickly by viewing the auto-generated code. Think of RoboScratch as training wheels for programming!\nAlso, the user interface is a little different than traditional block programming, by placing instructions which are connected with lines demonstrating the execution path. You may recognize this approach similar to creating flowcharts and process outlines. As you can see, the RoboScratch approach provides very strong educational value.\nThe Work Space\nThe workspace is where you create a sketch. Common functions and methods are displayed as element blocks. The element blocks can be dragged to the work space. Each element block includes attributes. The element blocks are connected with lines, which outlines the \"path of execution\". Starting from the first element, the program will executed each consecutive element ... One after another until the end.\n\nThe Code\nThe magic happens - pressing the Code tab will display the auto-generated code from the RoboScratch UI element blocks. The generated code also includes friendly and helpful comments which explain each line. Below is the auto-generated code from the above screenshot.\nGet Started\nStep 1\nLoad the default example project for your robot from either the top menu's File->Open option, or the EZ-Cloud->Open. Remember, the default example project is named after your robot, which will be JD, or Six, Roli, etc.. This was covered in the tutorials while assembling your robot. If your robot requires a servo profile, ensure you have loaded the one which was created during the assembly tutorials.\nStep 2\nEstablish a connection to your robot. This was also covered in the assembly tutorials. Connect to the robot's WiFi network, press the Connect button in EZ-Builder's connection control, and the Start button on the Camera Control to begin streaming the video.\nStep 3\nPress the RoboScratch window button to load the RoboScratch designer view.\n\nStep 4\nPress the RoboScratch window button to load the RoboScratch designer view. As you can see, the work space will be empty so you can begin right away!\n\nStep 5\nWe will start by demonstrating how to make the robot move forward for 3 seconds, stop, and speak a phrase.\nStep 6\nLocate and press the Move element from the side menu. This will add the Move Element to the work space. Select FORWARD from the Move Element's list of movement directions in the drop down. Optionally, you can hover the cursor over the blue question mark of an element in the work space to read additional details.\n \n\nStep 7\nLocate and add the Sleep element from the side menu. Enter the value of 3000 milliseconds, which is 3 seconds. Computers work very fast in the speed of milliseconds. Also, the term Sleep is used in computer programming, not delay as you may expect. The two have different meanings, which can be identified by reading the help by hovering your cursor over the blue question mark on the Sleep element.\n \n\nStep 8\nLocate and add the Move element again, and this time select STOP.\n\nStep 9\nNow we will make the robot speak by adding the Say And Wait Until Finished element. For fun, add your own custom text into the field to have your robot speak your name!\n\nStep 10\nNow press the START button in the top left and the robot will begin executing the command of each element. Notice how the RoboScratch elements will highlight in Yellow as they are being executed.\n \n\nView The Code\nThe goal of RoboScratch is to teach you how to program. This is done by converting your RoboScratch elements into real code! The code can be viewed by pressing the Source Code tab.\n\nFinished!\nYou have now mastered RoboScratch! Start experimenting by creating your own programs by adding elements. Hover your mouse cursor over the blue question marks to find out what an element does.",

      "title": "Fine Tune JDs Servos Profile",
      "description": "Fine Tune JDs Servos\nIntroduction\nIn this lesson, we will demonstrate how to create a servo profile for your JD from a PC using EZ-Builder. The Servo Profile creates offsets for each servo to compensate for physical limitations of motors and gearing alignments. We will use the Servo Fine Tune utility to create a profile that matches your JD's configuration. The only time you will need to repeat this process is if you disassemble JD or relocate the servos to different places on the robot's body.\n \nBefore You Begin\n*Important: If a servo requires more than 10 degrees of fine tune, this means the servo must be manually re-aligned. If you find a servo requires more than 10 degrees of alignment, view the complete JD tutorial and locate the Servo Calibration section by clicking HERE.\n \nServo Fine Tune Video\nIn the video below, we will demonstrate a few steps of this exercise by calibrating JD's arm servos. The video does not cover the entire calibration process, as the process should quite clear of the exercise.\n \n \nWhat You Will Need\n \n\nAn assembled and connected JD with charged battery\nA PC with latest EZ-Builder Installed\n\n \n\nStep 1\n\nConnect EZ-Builder to your JD. Press PROJECT from the top menu. Now press CONFIGURE under the Servo Profile section.\n\n \n\n\nThe Fine Tune Servo Profile utility will be displayed. Here you have a model of your robot and buttons located around the joints. These buttons have - and +, which allows you to SUBTRACT or ADD positions to move the servos into alignment. In the next steps, you will press the - and + buttons on each joint to align the servos. Once you have completed the alignment, you will be instructed to save this servo profile so you never have to do this process again (unless you disassemble and reassemble JD).\r\n \r\n *Note: If you disassemble and reassemble JD, you will be using servos in different places on the robot. By doing so, you will have to redo his step.\n\n \n\nStep 2\n\nWhen JD is first connected, he will move into the calibration mode. Stand up JD on a flat surface.\n\n \n\nStep 3\n\nPress the + and - buttons on JD's ankle servos to adjust the ankles until the feet are parallel/flat with the surface.\n\n \n\nStep 4\n\nNow use the + and - buttons to align the knee lever to be parallel with the servo housing. This is the 90 degree position, similar to the process when calibrating the servos manually. However, this time you are fine tuning to be more precise.\n\n \n\nStep 5\n\nUse the + and - buttons to align the Upper Leg servo to be parallel with the servo housing. This is the 90 degree position, similar to the process when calibrating the servos manually.\n\n \n\nStep 6\n\nUse the + and - buttons to align the arm elbow lever servos to be parallel with their servo housing. This is the 90 degree position.\n\n \n\nStep 7\n\nUse the + and - buttons to rotate and align the shoulder lever servos to be parallel with JD's Body. This is the 90 degree position.\n\n \n\nStep 8\n\nUse the + and - buttons to align the vertical neck servo to be 90 degree upright from JD's Body. This is the 90 degree position.\n\n \n\nStep 10\n\nWe will now save the Servo Profile that you have created for JD. Press the SAVE button and the Save File dialog will appear. Enter a descriptive file name for this Servo Profile. (such as \"JD Alignment\")\r\n \r\n *Note: Now that you have created and saved a Servo Profile for JD, you will be asked to select the profile every time you load any JD project. The only time you would need to create a new Servo Profile is if you disassemble JD.\n\n \n\nComplete\nAdvance to the next lesson - you are almost ready to having JD doing awesome stuff!\n",
