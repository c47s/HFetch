HFetch is the solution to the aforementioned problem of forgotten homework.
It runs a shell script which downloads course information,
	then uses this to determine the IDs of the courses
	and goes on to query the server as to the assignments in each of these courses.
Once the assignments have been obtained,
	the script passes them on to HFetch to be displayed and exits.
If, however jq\cite{jq}, a JSON parser, isn't installed or the files storing the user's API credentials are missing, 
	the shell script returns an error which HFetch identifies and leads the user through the installation of jq
	and possibly the package manager Homebrew,
	or the obtaining and entry of their credentials,
	passing these to the shell script,
	which saves them on the disk.
