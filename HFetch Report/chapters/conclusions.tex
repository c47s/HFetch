These programs make homework easier to remember,
	and allow for automation, such as with the cron utility\cite{cron} or Automator\cite{automator} on MacOS.
With cron, for instance, the app's executable could be scheduled to run at certain times and remind the student of their upcoming assignments.
Furthermore, with Automator, HFetch could be run with a keystroke or as a dictation command (by speaking).

In the future, a user interface should be created for Linux as the current one is written in AppleScript,
	new versions of this program should be created for Windows and iOS,
	and a similar client for the Powerschool API should be created or added as a part of HFetch.
