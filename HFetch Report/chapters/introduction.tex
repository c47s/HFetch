Schoology is a learning management system (LMS), a website on which teachers can post assignments and resources for their students to access anywhere.\cite{scgy-promo}
Navigating to Schoology is inconvenient,
	and once on the site,
	all that is usually needed is the sidebar,
	which lists upcoming assignments.
It can be hard to remember to check Schoology,
	so an automated utility is extremely useful.
Because of this,
	a Unix shell script\cite{getassgns} was written which fetches assignments from the website,
	and an AppleScript App which displays the assignment information in a user-friendly GUI.
Bash and AppleScript, a MacOS scripting language, were chosen for this task because they integrate well and both run on MacOS,
	as the school that HFetch is intended for has an abundance of Macs.

Schoology has a RESTful API in order to allow for the creation of tools to enrich the Schoology experience.\cite{api-docs}
REST is a standard for web services which allows for the access and manipulation of web resources
	by way of a set of stateless,
	(each message is independent of the others) predefined operations.\cite{rest}
