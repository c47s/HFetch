HFetch was designed to solve the problem of students forgetting to check Schoology for their assignments. This ruins one of the main benefits of a learning management system: Teachers are able to post homework without explicitly telling the class, and can expect each student to complete the assignment. Failure to complete homework, in this case due to forgetfulness, can sabotage learning and ruin grades.
